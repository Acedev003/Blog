Among the first few coding challenges a newbie goes through is that of computing the Fibonacci Sequence. At a glance, this absurdly random question does not appear to offer any real world solutions, apart from the fact that it's used to demonstrate the concepts of recursion to new programmers.


Another good use-case of the Fibonacci sequence is to explain algorithmic complexity. So, lets begin by looking at the definition of the so called sequence.

As the above image shows, every n'th element of the sequence is the sum of the previous 2 elements.
